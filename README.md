# Coffee-Machine
Coffee Machine project as part of Angela Yu's 100 Days of Coding challenge, day 15.  Angela gave us the MENU dictionary and the resources dictionary (which I slightly modified), but the rest of the code is my own.  This one took a while for me to really get a program flow laid out that I felt was simplified enough, and maybe it's not perfect, but I'm happy with it.
